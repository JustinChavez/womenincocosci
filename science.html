                        <p>	
                            This is an exciting time! Welcome to college. Some of you
                            may have been awesome enough to start doing research in 
                            high school: major kudos to you, and I imagine you're 
                            already in the swing of things! For those of you who 
                            took more a typical path like I did, you probably don't 
                            even know what research <i>is</i>, not even considering
                            how to get involved. Luckily, there's no pressure to start
                            doing research the minute you get to college; most people 
                            start the beginning of their sophomore year, though the
                            earlier the better of course. What I recommend first-year
                            first-semester students do is settle into college. Do 
                            well in your science classes and try to get to know your
                            professors; you can ask to join their lab at the end of the 
                            semester if they have space. Meet with your academic advisor
                            and tell them about your interests; they can help too. 
                            Make friends! Specifically
                            with regards to research, upperclass-people science
                            friends are excellent (they're probably going to be your
                            TAs), but really college is all about making friends and 
                            settling in at this point. Research can be hard so you 
                            want to be healthy, happy, getting good grades, and enjoying
                            yourself when you get started, which means establishing 
                            a strong support system and enjoying meeting all of these
                            new people and having new experiences.                           
                        </p>

                        <p>	
                            Though you have until the beginning of sophomore year when you 
                            definitely should be doing research, I started my first-year spring, 
                            and if you can you should take the opportunity. At this point, you
                            haven't picked a major and you don't know what you're doing, so any
                            lab that will take you will work. If one of your professors from last
                            semester happens to have some space, definitely ask if you can join
                            their lab (I have some articles about how to do that below), otherwise,
                            email any professor whose work seems interesting! Professors know 
                            that at this stage undergrads are just exploring, and many of them
                            will be happy to take on new students (because if you stay then 
                            you're likely to stay long-term :)). I started in a physical chemistry
                            lab my first-year spring, and I ended up in neuroscience in the end.

                            This is also a good time to start thinking about summer research. 
                            It's hard to get REUs (summer research positions) and the more 
                            experience you have the easier they are to get. (... Bit of a catch-22
                            there. Unfortunately, in life the greatest evidence of future success
                            is past success, so it's always good to get started early :)). Most
                            people get their first summer research position at their home
                            institution, and the easiest way to do this is to continue working
                            in the lab you work in during the spring. So ask your lab if you 
                            can stay on, and then apply for the REU funding programs! You're also
                            welcome to try to apply to REUs outside your home institution; don't
                            be disappointed if you're not qualified enough yet, but applying is
                            always a great exercise and it's excellent to have diverse research
                            experience if you do get it.

                        <p>	
                            Summer research :). While I heartily advocate doing research during
                            the school year, you're probably only going to get in 10 hours per week
                            or so in the beginning. In the SUMMER, however, you're working around 40-45
                            hours per week (unless you're an overachiever, in which case go for it!)
                            which means you can get stuff done in a two weeks that would take you a
                            whole semester during the school year. This is probably the most important
                            time to do research, simply because it's a full-time job during the summer.
                            So try living on your own (...and cooking on your own!) for a summer and
                            hopefully you're enrolled in an REU program or associated with one. Most
                            REU programs have activities for their students to do outside of their
                            research-- ours had lectures, field trips, food events, and craft activities--
                            so it's a fun time, especially since you get to hang out with a whole
                            bunch of other students who are enthusiastic about science.

                            All right, here we are! If you haven't gotten started doing research yet, 
                            now's the time. You don't technically <i>need</i> to start now, but if you 
                            want to be a position where you could apply to graduate school reasonably
                            soon after you graduate, and be in a position where you KNOW whether you 
                            want to apply to graduate school (which only comes with time and 
                            experience), it's good to start now. When I was going through this process,
                            this was the time in which I switched into my permanent lab. I'd be in a 
                            physical chemistry lab during my first-year spring, and an environmental
                            science lab during my first-year summer, and now I entered the neuroscience
                            lab that I'd stay with for the next three years. There's different opinions
                            on whether to stay with one lab or switch around during your undergrad, and
                            this comes down to: you'll get more done if you stay in one lab, but you'll
                            have broader experiences if you switch around a little. Still, most people
                            have one "home" lab that they usually work in, because you really do need
                            to stay put to learn enough to accomplish anything. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Anyway, so you're working in a lab! Course credit / for pay / volunteer is
                            all good. Be patient with yourself-- it takes a LONG time before you're going
                            to be in a position where you can design experiments and run them effectively
                            (I'm still not at that point yet-- that's what being a graduate student is 
                            about). So just learn as much as you can-- skills-wise and environment-wise. 
                            There are a lot of skills to learn (which I don't talk about in this website)
                            and a lot to learn about how research is conducted.

                            Cool, you've got a semester of research under your belt! Carry on. Start
                            applying for summer REU positions (yes, you'll be doing this every summer.
                            It's how it goes). I stayed in my home lab during the summer, but this is
                            a good time to apply to REU positions at other schools / labs if you're 
                            interested in doing that! You're still early enough in that you're not
                            expected to do thesis-work over the summer, and it's a good opportunity
                            to see what other labs and locations are like.

                            Whohoo, you're a junior in college! Hopefully feeling on top of it. Classes
                            are getting better, since you're settled into your major and starting to take
                            upper-level classes, people are asking if you know what you want to do when 
                            you graduate... luckily that won't really kick in until your senior year. 
                            Hopefully you're pleased with the lab you're in! Research just continues on
                            in a holding pattern at this point. Maybe you're starting to take on more
                            responsibility in lab, maybe you're starting to train some newcomers in the lab.

                            Continue on. Apply for REUs, though likely that's going to be in your home
                            institution or in a lab affiliated with your home institution. If you can 
                            get funding to work in a lab that collaborates with yours-- so you'll still
                            be doing work related to your lab's but you get to travel-- that's always
                            a fun opportunity. I have friends who did this, but it depends on your school, 
                            and most of my friends (and I) just buckled down in our home labs during the 
                            summer.

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Note that this is also a good time to plan out and cement relationships
                            with professors who you want to write your recommendation letters for graduate
                            school (if you're planning to go that route, of course, but I assume you are
                            since that's what this website is aimed at :)). This happens organically, which
                            is why I haven't mentioned it before now, but if you have a chance to do an 
                            independent research project or take another interesting class with a professor 
                            who you have a good relationship with, take it! 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Finally, the real world's setting in, and now's the time when you need to 
                            start thinking about what you're going to do after you graduate (...I know, 
                            the earliness of this sucks). If you're applying to graduate school right out
                            of undergrad (i.e., in the fall) you can start prepping for that process. If 
                            you're not, but you're applying for the big national research fellowships (.e.g.
                            Marshall, Churchill) you need to get in touch with whoever does fellowship
                            advising at your school, because you should start getting in contact with potential
                            PIs during this spring.

                            All right! So this is when you're going to do most of your thesis work. Wait,
                            thesis? Yes! Not everyone has to do an undergraduate thesis, which is a long
                            essay describing the research you've done, but it's required at a lot of schools
                            and usually lets you graduate with honors. You don't want to be doing the majority
                            of your thesis work during the school year-- senior year is a busy time. You
                            want to have most of your lab work done by the time you start in the fall, so that
                            you'll have time for all of the inevitable extra experiments, doing data analysis,
                            doing literature review, and writing up. This is the summer to collect all of 
                            your data!
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Also, this is the summer to study for and take your GREs if you're thinking 
                            about graduate school a year or two out of undergrad. GREs are the standardized 
                            tests required for graduate school, and they come in two varieties: the general 
                            test, and subject tests. Just
                            like high-school SATs, the general test isn't too terrible (math, reading, writing)
                            and the subject tests are hard. I luckily only had to take the general GRE, so 
                            I studied for two months and then took it in August. If you have to take the 
                            subject GREs, you might need more time to study. Also, you have to book GRE
                            slots pretty far in advance-- the weekend slots fill up 2 months ahead, I think, 
                            especially if you want one in your area. Ah, all the other things besides research
                            that you need for graduate school... (research, grades, GRE, and rec letters!)

                        <p>	
                            Top of the school, people, congrats! Senior year is FUN because you're completely
                            settled in where you are. You're also taking the coolest classes that you've hand-picked
                            since who-knows-when, you're with all of your friends, and you actually know what
                            you're doing with your research. It's also crazy-busy because you're applying for
                            jobs AND taking classes AND devoting an insane amount of time to research AND having
                            a social life. Plus everyone keeps asking you what you're going to do next year. But
                            carry on! You're doing your thesis work (or writing up a paper, if your data is good!)
                            so you definitely know what you're doing research-wise. Retake the GREs if you didn't 
                            do well, or save that for winter break. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p> 
                            Most importantly, this is the time when you're applying for EVERYTHING. If you're heading
                            to graduate school right out of undergrad, you're doing your grad school applications...
                            and do NOT underestimate how long this process takes. (Though I know people who have done
                            it over Thanksgiving Break, I started in August and finished just in time for them to
                            be due on November / December.) 
                        </p>
                        <br> 
                        <p> 
                            If you're not applying to graduate
                            school right now, then you're still applying for everything, because you're applying to 
                            all of the fellowship positions which are due in the fall. The international ones especially
                            have internal and external review processes that mean you need to be on top of it. 
                            My senior fall was my hardest semester because I basically had six full-time classes:
                            research, applications, and my normal four classes, which were amazing but challenging.

                            Again, BUSY TIME. You have classes that you still need to pass and your thesis / research. 
                            But right now it's all about the applications. If you've applied to graduate school, Jan / Feb
                            is when you hear back about whether you've been invited to interview or not. If you've been
                            invited to interview, you need to prep for and schedule those visits (in Feb / March) 
                            and make up your classes. If you didn't apply to graduate school-- or if you did and didn't get
                            interview invitations-- you need to apply for 2-year research assistant positions, which really
                            open up in February. Check professors' websites, your institution's opportunities, and ask your
                            professor for recommendations. You need to be very qualified to get these positions, 
                            and they usually have interviews attached to them, so apply well. (I did a weird thing and 
                            went to do a 1-year research-only (not taught) Masters degree, but I don't know anyone else
                            who did it this way. The key point is to get some research experience, and to get paid to do 
                            it (...which I failed to do. Loans :P!))

                            Life is good. You've graduated. You know what you're doing next year. Most people either
                            start their new research positions, or get funding to wrap up their work at their home
                            lab and then start their positions in the fall. Life's good.

                            It's quite a change to not be a student all the time! People apply to 
                            graduate school when the grad school cycle comes around again (applications
                            are always due in Nov / Jan for enrolment in the following year) but 
                            in the meantime are doing research full-time, which most people enjoy.
                            (If you don't enjoy it, you need to stop applying for graduate school, since
                            this is basically what graduate school is like :)). It's a good life 
                            and a taste of what it'll be like in the future.
