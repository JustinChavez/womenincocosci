                <br>
                <p> It's hard to overstress the importance of picking your supervisor :). 
                    Students often think that the most important thing in choosing a lab 
                    is that the research is interesting. This is not the case in undergrad: 
                    what is most important in choosing a lab is, in the following order: </p>
                <br>
                <p> 1.	Your supervisor </p>
                <p> 2.	The people you will be working with </p>
                <p> 3.	The research </p>
                <br>
                <p> Keeping these things in mind will help to prevent unhappiness. 
                    And you might think: "who cares if I'm unhappy? I'll be doing cool 
                    research," but the ordering of this list is actually the same ordering as 
                    for career advancement. As an undergrad it does not matter what you study.
                    You will be set for graduate school as long as what you're studying is in
                    a sort-of-related field and it has sort-of-related techniques
                    (this last bit isn't essential, it's just helpful). What graduate schools
                    do care about
                    is if you have good science training. And to have good science training, 
                    you need a good supervisor. </p>
                <br>
                <p> Who is a good supervisor? </p>
                <br>
                <p> First of all, you should figure out whether the head of your lab is 
                    actually going to be your supervisor, which is not likely to be the case.
                    PIs often oversee the graduate students and post-docs, while undergrads 
                    are left to the graduate students and post-docs to manage. So you want to have a good 
                    a good manager— PI, post-doc, or graduate student. </p>
                <br>
                <p> If your manager isn't your PI, choosing a good mentor is somewhat out of 
                    your control. I'm told it works like this: the 
                    PI gets an email from an interested student. The PI sends an email out 
                    to the lab, asking if any graduate student wants an undergrad. If a graduate 
                    student wants an undergrad, that undergrad is assigned to the graduate 
                    student. </p>
                <br>
                <p> Regardless of who you will be working with, try to make sure they 
                    care about your development. Undergrads are pretty
                    useless in terms of doing research, because anything they can do graduate 
                    students and postdocs can do better and much, much faster. So you need to 
                    have someone who's interested in training you and making sure you learn 
                    something out of the experience, rather than being stuck doing gruntwork 
                    forever. (You're going to be doing some gruntwork, because graduate students
                    take on undergrads 1) to give back, 2) for their CVs, and 3) for gruntwork (see this
                    <a href="what_it_means_to_be_an_undergrad_in_research.html">post</a>), but 
                    make sure that eventually 
                    you'll be doing some thinking work too.) It helps if you get along with 
                    your supervisor. Don't underrate the value of niceness—there's going to 
                    come a time when you have a conflict and can't come in, and having an
                    understanding and flexible boss is very important. </p>
                <br>
                <p> How do you find these hypothetical supervisors, anyway? </p>
                <br>
                <p> That's where the research (before the actual research) comes in. Figure out
                    approximately what you want to work on. (In undergrad, for me, that was: 
                    neuroscience. Preferably with something larger than cells. That's about as
                    specific as you should get when you're first getting started.) The next 
                    step is to pull up the research pages of all the professors whose research
                    fits your criteria. Search the professor's name: everyone has to have a 
                    website in science these days. Check to see if they're taking undergrads—it's 
                    always worth emailing professors if their website doesn't say, but sometimes
                    professors will have a specific form for you to fill out. Email those 
                    professors (I have a separate <a href="how_to_write_an_email.html">post</a>
                    about emailing professors. 
                    Be veerrrrrry careful about that first email.) From the people who 
                    reply back, meet with them in person. </p>
                <br>
                <p> Here's the crunch point. If you only have one option but don't like the 
                    professor, it's probably still worth it to volunteer with them for a while,
                    but you should continue seeking out other professors. If you have multiple 
                    options, <i> ask around</i>. Choose the professor who is known to be the 
                    best mentor, and go with them, no questions asked research-wise. </p>
                <br>
                <p> Are you going to get paid? </p>
                <br>
                <p> Here's my philosophy about getting paid: in the US, you should have funding
                    for the summer. Apply to a LOT of places, especially your home institution,
                    so that you have funding for the summer. I couldn't afford to not get paid 
                    over the summer, and there are enough REUs (undergraduate research 
                    experiences) out there that you should get paid somewhere. </p>
                <br>
                <p> During the school year, try to get course credit; that's usually an
                    option. It can also be a surprising grade booster, oddly enough? But 
                    course credit is usually good just to show that you've done research 
                    consistently. If there's an offer for pay, I would take that. If you can 
                    apply for fellowships so that you can get paid to do research for the year,
                    definitely apply and definitely take that. If you have to volunteer, I'd do
                    that as well—at this point, you're an undergrad, so any research experience 
                    is good experience and it's fine not to get paid in the short-term. </p>
                <br>
                <p> What if I'm stuck in a lab I don't like? </p>
                <br>
                <p> Weeellll. This sucks. It's going to depend a lot on how large your school 
                    is. If you can switch to another lab, that's an excellent option. If your
                    school is small enough that you can't switch to another lab, then you're
                    probably going to have to stick it out. Professors have a lot of power if 
                    you want to stay in academia, and you can't forget that science is a people 
                    network. This isn't a big deal if you're not staying in academia, but if you
                    are, you need a recommendation letter from whomever you're working with to 
                    move to whomever you want to work with. But the problem of everyone knowing 
                    everyone else is a bigger problem in graduate school, and if you're just 
                    starting out, feel free to move around. In American undergrad, you're expected  
                    to jump around labs until you figure out what you want, so you'll 
                    likely have the chance to sample a bunch of different labs before you settle 
                    down. </p>
                <br>
                <p> <u> Conclusions </u> </p>
                <br>
                <p> Basically, make sure you're happy in whatever lab you end up in, and know 
                    that that's going to be much more a matter of the people you're working 
                    with rather than the research, because as an undergraduate you need 
                    training in science in general rather than any specific topic. You don’t 
                    know enough yet for specific knowledge to be particularly useful; you'll 
                    just be learning the process and how to think and work independently. 
                    Thus, supervisors are essential, and as long as you keep that mind you'll
                    have an awesome research experience! </p>
