                <p> You’ve finished an undergraduate science degree! What next? 
                    There are a few science jobs you can do straight out of 
                    undergrad, or with a masters degree. (Consulting, science 
                    writing, others? I'm regrettably not well-versed in this 
                    but I know they exist). If you want to work in 
                    industry or academia, however, you need a PhD. </p>
                <br>
                <p> <u>The Pathway: </u></p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                <li> Undergrad: 4 years of mostly coursework, with some research on the side. </li>
                <li> Research assistant / lab tech: 2 years of full-time research,
                    usually with administrative duties </li>
                <li> Graduate school: 5-7 years of research in pursuit of a PhD. The first two years 
                    have coursework, but starting from year 3 it’s just research. PhDs rarely 
                    go longer than 8 years (people run out of funding) and are rarely as 
                    short as 3 years (you have to be very, very good and lucky). If you 
                    work with animals or clinical populations, expect your PhD to be longer;
                    if you work in theory or with computers, your PhD will likely be shorter.</li> 
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p> Here we diverge. If you want to go into industry at this point, now’s 
                    the time! Industry has higher pay and nicer hours than academia. 
                    Science writing likes PhDs. I’m sure other careers do as well (I’ve 
                    just only looked into a few options). If you do want to continue 
                    in academia… </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                <li> Post-doctorate research: 1-5 years of being a “post-doc”. Post-docs 
                    are paid more than graduate students, but work crazy hard and so 
                    are still considered cheap labor :). Post-docs are the most 
                    productive people in the chain. They know how to do research 
                    (they earned their PhDs) and are doing research full-time. 
                    Post-doc positions are usually for 1-3 years, and people can do
                    several post-docs. People are often applying for faculty positions
                    during their post-docs. The goal is to publish as many papers 
                    as possible. </li>
                <br>
                <li> Faculty positions. There are several levels of faculty positions.
                    You start off as an assistant professor (first few years). You 
                    then become an associate professor (years 4-7?). Then you become
                    a full professor (… and because academia has something called 
                    “tenure”, which means you don’t get fired, this goes on until 
                    you decide to retire). Following this whole track is called 
                    “tenure-track”. If you fail to pass all of the benchmarks 
                    during tenure-track (which involves a lot of things but mainly 
                    publishing papers) you can be asked to leave your institution. 
                    You can also be on non-tenure-track positions, like being a 
                    "visiting professor" or "lecturer" which are paid 
                    less and are usually more temporary. You might be non-tenure 
                    track at an institution and then move to 
                    another institution where you are tenure-track: a lot of people 
                    stay with one institution, and a lot of people move. If you move 
                    when you already have tenure, you don’t have to start again at
                    the beginning, but I don't know how common this is. </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p> <u>Conclusions </u></p>
                    <br>
                <p> There is a lot of education associated with going into science.
                    In most cases you’ll need your PhD, which is an incredible 
                    amount of work. Make sure you want to do it before you start,
                    because you'll need to enjoy the process! </p>
