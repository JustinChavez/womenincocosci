                <p>I have some news that you're not going to want to hear:
                    if you're applying to graduate school right now,
                    you should simultaneously be applying for science fellowships.
                    I know, I know, it's a huge pain, but they can ask you about
                    it on your graduate applications ("Are you applying to
                    scholarships like the NSF?") (most people say yes) and for
                    the NSF, you have a much greater chance of getting it
                    the second year you submit. UPDATE: NSF has changed the rules in
                     2016-- you're now only allowed to apply for the NSF one time
                    once you've entered graduate school. No one has good advice yet
                    for whether you should apply your first or second year. </p>
                <br>
                <p>I only applied to the NSF Fellowship, but the two other big
                    ones for US students are the NDSEG and Hertz (which are
                    even more competitive).
                    See <a href=" http://obsessionwithregression.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/advice-and-sample-essays-for-rhodes.html">this post</a>
                    for some advice on international scholarships like the Rhodes and Marshall.</p>
                <br>
                <p> The good news is that the NSF application is pretty short.
                    Something to keep in mind is that you need recommendation
                    letters, and you really want someone / a few people to read
                    these over before you submit, so you have to get started fairly early. </p>
                <br>
                <p>There are three websites which were hugely helpful in applying: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href = "http://www.pgbovine.net/fellowship-tips.htm">Philip Guo's post</a></li>
                    <li><a href = "http://www.malloryladd.com/nsf-grfp-advice.html">Mallory Ladd's post</a></li>
                    <li><a href = "http://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship">Alex Lang has ALL the examples</a></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p> My biggest piece of advice is to read examples (read a LOT of examples) and to get
                  feedback from friends. Google Docs are most useful :).</p>
                <br>
                <p>Good luck! </p>
