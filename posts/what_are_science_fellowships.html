                <p>I have some news that you're not going to want to hear: 
                    if you're applying to graduate school right now, 
                    you should simultaneously be applying for science fellowships.
                    I know, I know, it's a huge pain, but they can ask you about 
                    it on your graduate applications ("Are you applying to 
                    scholarships like the NSF?") (most people say yes) and for 
                    the NSF, you have a much greater chance of getting it 
                    the second year you submit. </p>
                <br>
                <p>I only applied to the NSF Fellowship, but the two other big 
                    ones for US students are the NDSEG and Hertz (which are 
                    even more competitive). 
                    See <a href=" http://obsessionwithregression.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/advice-and-sample-essays-for-rhodes.html">this post</a> 
                    for some advice on international scholarships like the Rhodes and Marshall.</p>
                <br>
                <p> The good news is that the NSF application is pretty short. 
                    Something to keep in mind is that you need recommendation 
                    letters, and you really want someone / a few people to read
                    these over before you submit, so you have to get started fairly early. </p> 
                <br>
                <p>There are two websites which were hugely helpful in applying: </p>
                <ul>
