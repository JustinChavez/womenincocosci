                <p> There are some terms you'll hear over and over again in academia, 
                    and two of the most common are "paper" and "publish". Papers are 
                    the documents you write up to describe your research—usually several 
                    experiments all on the same theme. Papers have several parts: an 
                    Abstract, Introduction, Methods section, Results section, and 
                    Discussion section. In the Abstract, you have a summary of everything 
                    you cover in your entire paper (they are extremely useful). In the 
                    Introduction section, you describe where your study sits in the "literature", 
                    which is the collection of other peoples' papers that have been published on 
                    the topic. More specifically, you overview the literature and describe why 
                    your study is new and adds to the literature. In the Methods section, you 
                    describe what you did. Theoretically, your description will be detailed 
                    enough that someone else can replicate your experiment. This doesn't often 
                    happen in practice; rather, people contact the original researchers if 
                    they want to replicate experiments. In the Results section, you have all 
                    of your graphs (which are called "figures"), tables (large sets of numbers—
                    otherwise you put the numbers in the text of the results section), and the 
                    text describing the figures (and tables if you have them.) In the Discussion 
                    section, you describe what you results mean, and how it relates to the broader 
                    literature. Sometimes there's a conclusions section where everything you've 
                    done is summarized. </p>

                <br>

                <p> You're going to be reading a LOT of papers. Papers are very hard work 
                    to read mostly because they are aimed at people in the field. That 
                    means they will rely on concepts that you will likely be unfamiliar 
                    with and they will use jargon. Also, in science we tend to write in 
                    the passive voice, and there is a wide range of writing abilities, 
                    so things can be confusing even if the subject matter wasn't difficult. 
                    Usually when I need to learn about a new topic, I start with a review paper—
                    which is a paper that reviews a whole bunch of other papers in the literature. 
                    I read that fully and carefully, taking note of which other papers are referenced. 
                    Then I go read some more review papers and some of the primary literature 
                    ("primary literature" seems to be a somewhat ambiguous term in my head, 
                    but I feel it refers to all published studies that aren't review papers). 
                    As I become more familiar with the concepts, I start skimming. This differs 
                    based on the person, but I usually read the abstract, part of the introduction 
                    (usually the end of it, when they start describing the study), and the 
                    conclusion. Then I'll take a look at their figures to make sure the 
                    conclusions are supported, and skim through the methods if necessary. 
                    This is usually what you need to be familiar with if you're referencing
                    a paper—where their study fits into the literature, what point they made, 
                    and is their point supported. For papers where I'm not trying to make a 
                    strong point, I'll just check the abstract and some of the figures. For 
                    papers that I'm using extensively, I'll read through the whole thing 
                    and carefully evaluate it. </p>
                <br>
                <p> (I like this <a href="http://fraserlab.com/2013/09/28/The-Fraser-Lab-method-of-following-the-scientific-literature/">post</a>
                    for a description of what literature review looks like for a
                    more experienced scientist.) </p>
                <br>

                <p> Papers are the end-all-be-all of science. They show that you're doing 
                    work; they're the main determinants of whether you get funding or not. 
                    You'll hear "publish or perish", a colloquial phrase describing the 
                    fact that if you don't publish your work you'll be out of a job. 
                    Papers can be of differing qualities, and this will be reflected 
                    by the journal they are published in. Journals are rated by "impact 
                    factor" among other things, which is a measure of how much other 
                    people cite the papers they publish. The most prestigious journals 
                    vary by field, but everyone wants a paper published in Nature or 
                    Science. Another measure of how important a paper is the number of 
                    citations it has; usually the ranking of the journal it's published 
                    in and the number of citations are complementary in describing how 
                    important a paper is. </p>

                <br>

                <p> What's an important paper? Papers that have shown something new
                    and have the potential to drive a lot of other new research. 
                    Bad papers are papers which are variants on old research, or 
                    papers that don't work. People often don't publish work that 
                    didn't do what it was supposed do, though there is a movement 
                    trying to push against this. The argument is that people should 
                    publish their "negative results" (things that didn't work) so that 
                    other people don't try to replicate the work as well, wasting 
                    everyone's time. </p>

                <br>

                <p> Where do you find papers? There are different sources for finding 
                    papers, like PubMed or Web of Science, which are databases of 
                    sorted papers. I use Google Scholar almost exclusively, or the
                    search database associated with my school. There are a lot of 
                    great buttons on Google Scholar (Import into Endnote for citations, 
                    Related Articles, Cited By) but hopefully I'll get into that in 
                    another post. </p>

                <br>

                <p> Are papers free? Papers are not free, but as I was told, you
                    should never pay for a paper. Colleges buy subscriptions to 
                    journals so that their students can access papers for free. 
                    The nice thing about Google Scholar is that if you have a 
                    gmail account associated with a school, the free links to those 
                    papers will pop up as you're searching. Otherwise you can look 
                    through your school's database. Usually papers are available 
                    when you search them. Sometimes they're not—in that case, you 
                    can sometimes check the author's website and the paper will be 
                    available there. You can also order books from the library at 
                    your school if they aren't online, which occasionally works. 
                    The problem comes if you aren't associated with a college, in 
                    which case you're stuck. The system is unfair and flawed in that  
                    people who are associated with specific schools have increased 
                    access to papers; there's been a movement centering 
                    around "Open Access" that seeks to remedy this, but it's still
                     a solution in progress. In these cases people often 
                    check if friends have access.  </p>

                <br>

                <p> What are "citations"? Papers have authors. And the funny thing is that who
                    the authors are, and the order of the authors, really matters.
                    Who the authors are matters because every lab has a specific 
                    bent—they'll have a set of topics they investigate and a bias 
                    in what they're expecting to find. Some labs also do better 
                    science than others. Oddly enough, science is just as much about
                    the people as it is about the science, and this is one of the
                    ways that this comes through. The order of the authors on a
                    paper matters. This differs by field. In neuroscience and 
                    psychology, the last author is the name of the PI 
                    (principal investigator) of the lab—i.e. the head of the lab, 
                    the person who's in charge. The PI is consistent across years,
                    and is who has control over a lab's focus. The first author will be the 
                    graduate student or post-doc who did almost all of the work: 
                    at least collecting the data and analyzing the data. (The PI 
                    and graduate student / postdoc will have worked together to 
                    design the project and sometimes to write the paper.) Everyone 
                    else in the middle are people who did work on the project but
                    weren't the main author. </p>

                <br>

                <p> During a PhD, it's great if you can publish around one paper 
                    per year once you get going. This metric varies widely based on field 
                    and year. Computational papers are much easier to get out 
                    than papers which require an immense amount of data. The last
                    two years of a PhD make up almost all of a PhD student's 
                    productivity. And post-docs are highly trained, so they 
have higher output. </p>

                <p> <u> Conclusions </u> </p>

                <br>

                <p> Papers are extremely important in academia, and there are many
                    resources on how to write them. If you're in an
                    undergraduate science career, you'll undoubtedly be trained to
                    read papers, as soon as you transition out of reading 
                    textbooks into reading about all of the new stuff that's
                    being done! </p>
