                    <p>A lot of scientists have their own websites
                        (e.g. <a href = " http://web.mit.edu/zsaygin/www/">Zeynep Saygin</a>,
                        <a href=" http://stevenpinker.com">Steven Pinker</a>,
                        <a href=" http://annecollins.github.io">Anne Collins</a>).
                        Mostly, scientists make their websites through their institutions, 
                        or on pre-built sites like Wordpress. I took the route of making a 
                        website from scratch (i.e., learning html and css) and
                         it took a LONG time. I wouldn't 
                        recommend it if you're not interested in it for its 
                        own sake, though it doesn't take too long to pick up 
                        (it's just all of the details that you get stuck on,
                        as it always is with coding). It's made a lot quicker 
                        if you download a template as well, rather than doing 
                        everything from scratch. </p>

                    <p>If you do want to learn some basic web 
                        development, here are some webpages I found 
                        helpful. My background is someone who has some 
                        programming experience but who doesn't know anything 
                         about web development. </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>I primarily used 
                        <a href="http://www.jonhmchan.com/blog/2014/4/28/finally-a-guide-to-hosting-your-website">this website</a>.</li>
                    <li>And soon enough that led to using github pages: see
                        <a href="http://spector.io/how-to-set-up-github-pages-with-a-custom-domain-on-gandi/">this post</a>.</li>
                    <li>I then had to figure out github, which
                        is not as straightforward as it initially appears. I found 
                        <a href = "http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/">this guide</a> helpful.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Best of luck! I find it miraculous that this works at all; 
                        there are some fantastic resources out there. 
                        Googling's your best friend! </p>
