                <p>A lot of scientists have their own websites
                    (e.g. <a href = " http://web.mit.edu/zsaygin/www/">Zeynep Saygin</a>,
                    <a href=" http://stevenpinker.com">Steven Pinker</a>,
                    <a href=" http://annecollins.github.io">Anne Collins</a>).
                    Mostly, scientists make their websites through their institutions, 
                    or on pre-built sites like Wordpress. I took the route of making a 
                    website from scratch (i.e., learning html and css) and
                    it took a LONG time. I wouldn't 
                    recommend it if you're not interested in it for its 
                    own sake. None of the individual parts are too
                    difficult; it's just as fiddly as coding always is :). It can be
                    made a lot quicker if you download a template though, rather than doing 
                    everything from scratch! </p>
                <br>
                <p>If you did want to learn some basic web 
                    development, here are some webpages I found 
                    helpful. My background is someone who has some 
                    programming experience but who doesn't know anything 
                    about web development. </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li> The first thing you need to do is to figure out how to
                        make a website-- you can make one locally, on your computer,
                        and it'll look just like a real website except you can't 
                        access it from the internet. There are loads of sites that
                        can help you learn to put one together: I used codeacademy. I 
                        got about halfway through their <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website">Make
                            a Website</a> module then switched over to their
                        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/skills/make-an-interactive-website">Make 
                            an Interactive Website</a> module, which I completed. This goes
                        faster if you have existing coding experience, but the site estimates
                        it will take 4 hours for the first link and 5 hours for the second.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> After you've made a website on the online codeacademy site, you sit there 
                        and think: ...and how do I get this onto my own computer? I started searching around
                        for any application I could download which would support html files, and 
                        I ended up downloading <a href="https://netbeans.org">Netbeans</a>, which is 
                        free. I then basically tried to create the website I'd made with codeacademy on
                        my computer, which took some fiddling. After that I downloaded an 
                        <a href="http://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates">existing html template</a> 
                        to see how one organized one's folder structure, and
                        also to see how people made websites without using Bootstrap, which is
                        used in codeacademy. And after that I started copying and pasting stuff
                        from the codeacademy website and the free template websites and other nice
                        interactive things I Googled. (You think I wrote the Timeline on the 
                        Science page? No way! And that was free as long as I didn't delete the
                        attributions in the code comments!) So I did lots of Googling and fiddling
                        until everything looked reasonable, which took a while.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Finally I got to the point where I had a nice website on my computer, but
                        had no idea how to get it onto the internet. And up to this point Google had 
                        been excellent, but it was unusually difficult to find a resource to tell me
                        how to post this thing. (You'll notice that's a theme. There
                        are resources about each of these steps, but the transitions are really 
                        weak. The process I'm outlining might be a completely convoluted way to make a 
                        website: I have no idea because I was fumbling/Googling myself around.) Until I found this beautiful
                        <a href="http://www.jonhmchan.com/blog/2014/4/28/finally-a-guide-to-hosting-your-website">website,</a>
                        which told me how to post what I'd made!</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>That website was very instructional. It also informed me that I still wasn't 
                        done with the tutorials :). I ended up 
                        putting all of my code on Github as instructed, but I hadn't used Github before 
                        and it is not as straightforward as my computer science friends had made it seem. I found 
                        <a href = "http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/">this guide</a> helpful.
                    (And still spent many a frustrated hour trying to get it to work. Now I have a pipeline. It involves
                     forcing a lot of "commits" (a Github thing) through, which is bad practice but works brilliantly. Also, you need
                     to learn how to use your computer's terminal, but I figure you already learned how to do that
                     when you were learning how to use command line-ish things in html. Oh dear. This stuff takes more 
                     background than I thought.)</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> And then I bought a domain name (my first payment!)
                        on Gandi as instructed and set it up with github. Here's the awesome
                        <a href="http://spector.io/how-to-set-up-github-pages-with-a-custom-domain-on-gandi/">post</a> 
                        I used for that!</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> It was quite a process, if you can't tell-- all of these steps took a solid amount of
                        time. My knowledge about web development is also interestingly piecemeal now (I feel like I'm 
                        using all the wrong technical verbs when writing this post). I do suspect
                        there was a more A -> B way to do this, but I'm pleased: I'd 
                        been wanting to learn these skills for a while 
                        and I'm happy with the end result.  </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Best of luck! I find it miraculous that this works at all; 
                    there are some fantastic resources out there. 
                    Googling's your best friend! </p>
