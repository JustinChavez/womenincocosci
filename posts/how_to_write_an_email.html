                <p>I'm going to put up all sorts of flashy warning lights here, 
                    because this is where I messed up in 
                    undergrad so I'm unduly conscious of this mistake. The 
                    first email you send to a professor is a large determinant of 
                    whether you get to work with them or not, so it's very important. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Emails you send to professors are similar between
                    undergraduate and graduate students; the difference is that 
                    you have to be a lot more specific about what you know, what 
                    you've done, and what you want in a graduate student email 
                    compared to an undergraduate student email. I'll include a 
                    graduate student email at the end so that you can see how 
                    this process of email-writing develops after you've 
                    accumulated some experience. But let's start with the 
                    slimmed-down version: a template for an undergraduate email.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Dear Prof. [], </p>
                <p><i>*use Dear, not Hi or Hello. Make sure you say 
                        Professor / Dr. and not Mr. / Mrs.; these people have 
                        PhDs and faculty positions, both of which are hard 
                        to acquire and worth acknowledging.</i> </p>
                <br>
                <p>I am an undergraduate student in [major] <i>(*don't 
                        cite your minor; if it's not in science/math it's not 
                        relevant)</i>. I am very interested in your
                        work, specifically <i>[one sentence, e.g. how 
                    children learn language based on listening to

                    read on their website. Your project will almost always be 
                    disjoint from whatever you say here; the point 
                    is just to show that you went to the effort to 
                    look up what they do]</i>. I have previously worked 
                    in Prof. [so-and-so's] lab on a project 
                    investigating <i>[e.g. how auditory perception 
                    works in birds (showing how you're qualified). 
                    If you haven't worked in anyone's 
                    lab before, say: I have become interested in your
                    work because of my coursework in x (showing why  
                    you're interested)]</i>.
                    I would enjoy the opportunity to work on <i>[x, 
                    if you can suggest a project topic]</i> in your lab 
                    as a <i>[volunteer / for course credit since I saw 
                    you were advertising on your website / showing 
                    your level of time commitment / (omit this if you're 
                    not sure)]</i> during the <i>[time 
                    period, e.g. spring semester.]</i> </p>
                <br>
                <p>If this would be of interest to you, I am happy to meet 
                    whenever you're available and forward any materials. 
                    <i>[If you have a CV with research experience, you'll probably 
                    have described that research experience above and attached 
                    a more detailed CV anyway. But I don't think it hurts to
                    offer; maybe they want to see a transcript or something.]</i> 
                    Thank you for your time. </p>

                <p>…</p>
                <br>
                <p>There are several points here. The most important are that this
                    email is short, professional, and shows interest. I'm not 
                    going to reference the above template, 
                    but just write a quick email from scratch; you can see how brief
                    it is given that hypothetical me doesn't have any 
                    qualifications yet. </p>
                <br>

                <p>Inbox Title: Undergraduate interested in your lab</p>
                <br>
                <p>Dear Prof. McCartney, </p>
                <br>
                <p>I'm an undergraduate student in the Neuroscience major here.
                    I was reading about your work on color perception on your 
                    website and am very interested in how babies learn to see 
                    color. I have taken Neuroscience 100 and enjoyed reading 
                    about visual perception; I hope to become involved in research 
                    to understand more. I would love to work in your lab if that
                    would be of interest to you. I am happy to come by during 
                    your office hours if you were taking students at the moment. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Thank you for your time regardless,</p>
                <p>Rebecca Shellings</p>
                <br>
                <p>…</p>
                <br>
                <p> Luckily, as an undergrad professors don't expect that much of you;
                    they're just pleased if you show interest. 
                    But if you were to put together an email along these lines-
                    ignore the specific phrasing, which I think is a bit clunky-
                    that would increase your chances of getting into a popular lab.
                    The goal is that you 1) show you've 
                    looked the lab up, 2) show your interest, 3) show your 
                    qualifications / why you're interested, 4) show your availability
                    and willingness to meet, 5) be brief, and 6) be deferential. 
                    Professors usually want undergrads: it looks good on their
                    CVs and grant applications, and they want people who have gone 
                    to all of the work to be 
                    interested and written a nice email. With luck, the professor 
                    will foist you off on a senior student or graduate student 
                    who is interested in mentoring you, and it'll all go smoothly
                    from there. </p>
                <br>
                <p> Keep in mind that this is all you need. When I was learning to write
                    these I struggled most with
                    what I still find is a weird convention:
                    you just don't express that much emotion in these types of emails.
                    Using the word "love" is highly questionable. As someone who frequently uses emoticons
                    and enthusiastic adjectives for emphasis, I was constantly told to tone it down;  
                    the most enthusiastic you can
                    get is "I'm very interested". So don't use extravagant language and
                    KEEP IT BRIEF (professors skim emails): straightforward and to the 
                    point and you'll be golden. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Just for comparison, here's one of my (slightly edited) 
                    emails that I wrote in applying for graduate school. There
                    is a huge difference between the expectations for 
                    undergraduates versus graduates, which you will easily 
                    breach once you've gained all of the requisite research
                    experience. I still have language problems in this email,
                    and I think it's too long. However, this type of thing did 
                    get me into graduate school so there are good points in it.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>…</p>
                <br>
                <p>Dear Prof. [x], </p>
                <br>
                <p>My name is [x] and I am a recent neuroscience graduate from 
                    [institution] College. I am planning to apply to 
                    [institution]’s Neuroscience program this fall, and am very 
                    interested in your work. I wanted to ask if you were taking 
                    graduate students in the fall of 2016? </p>
                <br>
                <p>As an undergraduate I worked for three years in Prof. 
                    [my PI] lab at [institution], which allowed me the opportunity
                    to hear your talk during the [x] undergraduate program this 
                    summer. I enjoyed your discussion of the brain’s representation
                    of animacy and real-world object size at that time, and 
                    recently I have been enjoying reading your more recent 
                    papers on the brain’s representations of objects and what
                    features are governing the organization of those 
                    representations. My interests are in understanding the 
                    computational and neural bases of human perception and 
                    learning, and I would love to use various analysis methods 
                    with fMRI, combined with behavioral studies, to investigate 
                    high-level visual representations in your lab, if that were 
                    of interest to you and I were accepted into [institution]’s 
                    graduate program. </p>
                <br>
                <p>In Prof. [my PI]’s lab I had the opportunity to process 
                    fMRI data from subjects using FreeSurfer, and I have created 
                    anatomical and functional ROI labels in anatomical and 
                    diffusion-tensor-imaging space. Though I have never performed
                    MVPA or representational analyses, I designed a mock proposal 
                    using MVPA in Prof. [x]’s “[class name]” as a student at 
                    [institution], and I am familiar with the computational 
                    concepts from taking “[class name]” at [institution]. My 
                    most longstanding project in Prof. [my PI]'s lab was analyzing
                    electrophysiology data in Matlab, and I replicated part of 
                    two computational color papers in Matlab as part of an 
                    independent study with Prof. [y] ([institution] Computer 
                    Science Department) my senior year. As part of my senior 
                    thesis, I also created a small PsychToolbox perceptual 
                    experiment for human subjects. I have classroom knowledge 
                    of Java and some experience with Python. </p>
                <br>
                <p>This year I am pursuing a one-year, research-only Masters 
                    in Psychology at the [institution], working with Dr.
                    [new PI]. Dr. [new PI] investigates the learning strategies 
                    that humans use to automatically extract structure from
                    visual stimuli, and how the brain’s representations change
                    as a consequence of this learning. She uses behavioral 
                    studies, fMRI, and computational modeling in her work, and 
                    I hope to gain experience in using these techniques to 
                    investigate visual perception and cognition in her lab. </p>
                <br>
                <p>I would love to work with you on extracting the higher-order
                    features that govern how we perceive and represent visual 
                    stimuli if that would be of interest to you. I have attached 
                    a CV and would be happy to provide any other information, 
                    and thank you very much for your time. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Sincerely,  </p>
                <p>[x] </p>
