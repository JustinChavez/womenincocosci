                <p>This <a href="http://benjvincent.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/what-to-ask-biomedical-graduate.html">post</a> 
                    by Ben Vincent is excellent, and highlights the topics to ask
                    graduate students in different years of their PhDs. </p>
                <br>
                <p>This <a href="http://www.malloryladd.com/blog/24-questions-to-ask-before-choosing-a-graduate-program">post</a>
                    by Mallory Ladd also has a great list. </p>
                <br>
                <p>My lovely labmate Lizzie suggested the following questions: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> What are the lab working hours? </li>
                    <li> How often do you see your supervisor? </li>
                    <li> Do you work directly with your supervisor? </li>
                    <li> How does authorship work on papers? </li>
                    <li> How often do people publish? </li>
                    <li> How soon do people publish? </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>The fantastic Dr. Kovacikova suggested the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> how students interact with each other, what do they think about the school / program / mentors / peers </li>
                    <li> interaction between teachers and students </li>
                    <li> quality of support stuff (administration mainly) </li>
                    <li> what schools provide for you </li>
                    <li> possibility to branch out of the established system (join research with other departments or schools) </li>
                    <li> look into funding/possibility to get independently funded </li>
                    <li> health/sport/fun activities </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Additional things I tended to ask: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> What do you do on weekends? </li> 
                    <li> What kind of activities do you do outside lab? </li>
                    <li> How does funding work? </li>
                    <li> Do people teach more than the minimum requirements? </li>
                    <li> Do people do science public outreach? </li>
                    <li> Are you friends with your labmates? </li>
                    <li> Where do you work every day? </li>
                    <li> What's something bad and something good about your life right now? </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p> Have fun! Talking to graduate students is a great experience
                    no matter what you ask them. </p>
