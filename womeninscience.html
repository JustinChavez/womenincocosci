                            out there! We all have our own lists; here's a few
                            who are my personal heroes / whose work I admire. </p>

                                    Prof. <a href="http://churchlandlab.labsites.cshl.edu">Anne Churchland</a>
                                    (Cold Spring Harbor) keeps an updated list of
                                    female systems neuroscientists which I found
                                    very helpful in searching for labs! Prof. Churchland
                                is also one of my examples to live up to in science. </li>
                                <li> Prof. <a href="http://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/">Nancy Kanwisher</a>
                                    (MIT) is one of my personal heroes.
                                    She is at the center of a web of an extraordinarily large
                                    <a href="http://neurotree.org/neurotree/tree.php?pid=545">web</a>
                                    of people, and is an excellent research, mentor, and teacher
                                    besides. (How often do you get that combination?) The
                                    experience of taking her fMRI course was a bit life-changing
                                    for me, and she has all sorts of resources on her <a href="http://nancysbraintalks.mit.edu">braintalks</a> website.
                                    Her <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/nancy_kanwisher_the_brain_is_a_swiss_army_knife?language=en">Ted Talk</a>
                                    is great as well. </li>
                                <li> Have you ever been asked: "What's the coolest thing
                                    in science?" This question is completely unanswerable, but
                                    I always describe <a href="http://saxelab.mit.edu">Rebecca Saxe</a>'s work as
                                    an example of science that is awfully cool. Her <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/rebecca_saxe_how_brains_make_moral_judgments?language=en">Ted Talk</a>
                                    describes her work on the brain basis for Theory of Mind
                                    (thinking about other peoples' thoughts).</li>
                                <li> There are so many great people in neuroscience /
                                    cognitive science, etc. <a href="http://www.psych.upenn.edu/stslab/">Sharon Thompson-Schill</a>'s
                                    work, lab philosophy, and mentoring are incredible (Penn); I
                                    very much enjoyed learning about work from

                                  local, but things like this should be available elsewhere!) Outreach opportunities:

                                    is amazing: it brings attention to

                                    There are a few that the computer science women
                                    in my university always go to en masse every year,

                                because it rings
                                so ridiculously true. Graduate students
                                are often at the mercy of their supervisors,
                                and today's lab culture does not do much
                                to protect students from sexual harassment

                                 by Sheila Dwyer,
                                 who is part of the Physics team that in January 2016 reported the
                                 Nobel-shoe-in discovery of gravitational waves. </li>
                            <li> [Controlled Gender Bias Study] One study: When scientists are given identical CVs except
                                that one name is "Jennifer" and the other "John",
                                "Jennifer" is judged as less competent and is offered
                                $4000 less per year on average. (<a href="http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2014/why-does-john-get-stem-job-rather-jennifer">Example popular press article</a>.)</li>
                            <li> [Numbers Problem] The "leaky pipeline" has been an ongoing discussion
                                about how to keep women in science and engineering.
                                Women make up the majority of science majors in college
                                but the numbers continually decrease in the more
                                powerful and high-paying positions. (An example
                                <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/411461/why-women-leave-science/">article</a>;

                                there are many and this debate continues to change.)</li>
                            <li> [Science and Family] There is a LOT of evidence and discussion about having
                                a family and being science, and how this is disproportionally
                                harder for women. Here's an example <a href="Pay gap for women-- especially https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160510093904.htm">article</a>
                                on the pay gap
                                between scientists and its interaction with family.</li>

                                especially. If this pertains to you, there
                                are communities of others who feel the same way.
