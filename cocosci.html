                    I was amazed to discover the field of Computational Cognitive
                    Science exists, especially at such
                    an exciting time in its development. Cocosci is a new and growing
                    field that is heavily interdisciplinary. I'll leave it to a sampling
                    of experts to describe! </p>

                            Through a combination of mathematical modeling, computer simulation, 
                            and behavioral experiments, we try to uncover the logic behind our 
                            everyday inductive leaps: constructing perceptual representations, 
                            separating “style” and “content” in perception, learning concepts 
                            and words, judging similarity or representativeness, inferring 
                            causal connections, noticing coincidences, predicting the future.</i></p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i> We approach these topics with a range of empirical methods —
                            primarily, behavioral testing of adults, children, and machines
                            — and formal tools — drawn chiefly from Bayesian statistics and 
                            probability theory, but also from geometry, graph theory, and 
                            linear algebra. Our work is driven by the complementary goals 
                            of trying to achieve a better understanding of human learning 
                            in computational terms and trying to build computational

                            computational and statistical foundations of human 
                            inductive inference, and using this understanding to 
                            develop both better accounts of human behavior and 
                            better automated systems for solving the challenging 
                            computational problems that people solve effortlessly 
                            in everyday life. We pursue this goal by analyzing 
                            human cognition in terms of optimal or "rational" 
                            solutions to computational problems. For inductive 
                            problems, this usually means developing models based 
                            on the principles of probability theory, and exploring 
                            how ideas from artificial intelligence, machine 
                            learning, and statistics (particularly Bayesian 
                            statistics) connect to human cognition. We test 
                            these models through experiments with human subjects, 
                            looking at how people solve a wide range of inductive 
                            problems, including learning causal relationships, 
                            acquiring aspects of linguistic structure, and forming 
                            categories of objects.</i></p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i> Probabilistic models provide a way to explore many 
                            of the questions that are at the heart of cognitive 
                            science. As rational solutions to a problem, they 
                            can indicate how much information an "ideal observer" 
                            might extract from the available data, and provide 
                            information about the nature of the constraints that 
                            are needed in order to guarantee good inductive 
                            inferences. By making it possible to associate discrete 
                            hypotheses with probabilistic predictions, they allow 
                            us to explore how statistical learning can be combined 
                            with structured representations. By enabling us to 
                            define models of potentially unbounded complexity, 
                            they can also be used to answer questions about how 
                            well the complexity of these structured representations
                            is warranted by the data. Finally, the extensive 
                            literature on schemes for constructing computationally 
                            efficient approximations to probabilistic inference 
                            provides a source of clues as to psychological and 
                            neural mechanisms that could support inductive inference,
                            and new experimental methods for collecting information 
                            about people's beliefs and inductive biases.</i></p> 
                    <br>
                    <p><i> The working hypothesis that probability theory 
                            gives a formal account of human inductive 
                            inference establishes connections between 
                            cognitive science and current research in machine 
                            learning, artificial intelligence, and statistics. This 
                            means that probabilistic models of cognition can establish
                            a route for ideas in these disciplines to be explored 
                            as explanations for how people learn, and for our investigation
                            of human cognition to inform the development of new methods 
                            for making automated systems that learn.</i></p>

                            behavior. We use a combination of behavioral, neuroimaging
                            and computational techniques to pursue these questions. </i></p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>One prong of this research focuses on how humans and animals 
                            discover the hidden states underlying their observations,
                            and how they represent these states. In some cases, these 
                            states correspond to complex data structures, like graphs, 
                            grammars or programs. These data structures strongly constrain 
                            how agents infer which actions will lead to reward. A second prong 
                            of our research is teasing apart the interactions between different
                            learning systems. Evidence suggests the existence of at least two 
                            systems: a "goal-directed" system that builds an explicit model of
                            the environment, and a "habitual" system that learns state-action 
                            response rules. These two systems are subserved by separate neural
                            pathways that compete for control of behavior, but the systems may
                            also cooperate with one another. </i></p>

                <h4> Resources </h4>
                <br>
                <p> If you don't come from a computer science background but still want
                    to get involved in cocosci, it's definitely possible! There are a
                    lot of resources available to catch you up. Here 
                    are some I found helpful. <p>
                    <br>
                <h2> Coursework </h2>
                <br>
                <p> If you're still in undergrad and have the opportunity to take 
                    courses, these are useful classes. If you've finished undergrad, 
                    you'll likely be picking up concepts from these fields as you go along.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Math</b>: Statistics and Probability (make sure this includes
                        Bayesian statistics rather than just Frequentist statistics!), 
                        Single-Variable Calculus, Multi-Variable Calculus,
                        Linear Algebra, Differential Equations</li>
                    <li> <b>Computer Science (General)</b>: If you're not from a CS background, 
                        all CS classes you take will be helpful. You need to know how
                        to program: Python is excellent, and you should try to be familiar with
                        an object-oriented language (e.g. C, Java). I'm not as familiar 
                        with the theoretical side, but know Graph Theory is useful.
                    <li> <b>Computer Science (Specific)</b>: This is the most important. 
                        Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing,
                        Computational Cognitive Science... these aren't background classes though,
                        they ARE the classes in the field. 
                    <li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>: Cognitive Psychology, Neuroscience, Philosophy,
                        general science courses. </li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h2> Machine Learning </h2>
                <br>
                <p> What is machine learning? <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-origins-of-machine-learning">This post
                    </a> provides a nice history. Prof. Andrew Ng's <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Coursera 
                        course</a> is probably the most recommended
                    resource available, and everyone I know who has done it (including myself) highly enjoyed it.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1"> This post</a> describes a comprehensive list 
                        of machine learning resources. </li>
                    <li> I was recommended, from within the list in the above post, the following textbooks:
                        <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Machine-Learning-Probabilistic-Perspective-Computation/dp/0262018020/">
                            Machine Learning</a>, and
                        <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Machine-Learning-Probabilistic-Perspective-Computation/dp/0262018020/">
                            Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</a>. 
                    </li>
                    <li> Miscellaneous: Russell and Norvig's textbook is a very nice introduction to artificial intelligence. </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2> CocoSci </h2>
                <br>
                <p> There a few textbooks on cocosci that I've run across, and I'm just posting
                    them as I go along. I have nowhere near good coverage of everything!
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://probmods.org">probmods</a>, an online textbook called "Probabilistic Models of Cognition" by Noah Goodman and Josh Tenenbaum </li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/practical-probabilistic-programming#downloads">Textbook</a> called "Practical Probabilistic Programming" by Avi Pfeffer. I haven't tried this one, but it looks interesting.</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/robbie/jacobslab/cheat_sheets.html">"Computational Cognition Cheat Sheets"</a> from the Jacobs lab</li>
                </ul> 
                <br>
                <h2> The Literature </h2>
                <br>
                <p> Start reading papers from the labs mentioned above to get a sense of the 
                    field. It's a very exciting time :). </p>
                <br>
                   <hr>
                   <br>
                <h2> ... And Fun Stuff </h2>
                <br>
                <p> Cool computer science / machine learning / neuroscience / 
                    miscellaneous stuff I've come across. </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Playing around <a href=http://playground.tensorflow.org/>online</a> with neural networks! </li>
                    <li>A class I really wanted to take: <a href=" http://cs.wellesley.edu/~vision/readings.html">9.523: Aspects of a Computational Theory of Intelligence</a> taught at MIT</li>
                    <li>An essay on <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">"What is Code"</a> (I'm going to get through this whole thing someday)</li>
                    <li>These <a href="http://www.inference.eng.cam.ac.uk/itila/">lectures</a> on Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms by David MacKay are also on my reading list.</li>
                    <li>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbsqaJwpu6A">lecture</a> by Demis Hassabis, founder of DeepMind and previously a neuroscientist!</li>
                    <li>A cool Nature <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v482/n7386.html">paper</a> on artificial intelligence, if I remember correctly</li>
                    <li>Joscha Bach has cool <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRdJCFEqFTU&app=desktop">lectures</a> on computation and the mind</li>
                    <li>This will never not be insanely cool: <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence-dreams/">what happens</a> if you run a neural network trained on paintings backwards 
                    <li>"Algorithms To Live By", a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1627790365">book</a> written by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths on how computational principles can apply in every day life. Really enjoyed it </li>
