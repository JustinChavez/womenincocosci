                        <p> Don't be alarmed if you observe that academic comics
                            seem to pride themselves
                            on the degree of despairing cynicism they can convey 
                            (with the exception of xkcd usually). On the one hand,
                            it's excellent for getting a feel of the trials of the
                            research world, and on the other they give
                            a sense of comfort and community as we go along the pathway. 
                            (You don't need a comic for all the happy things!)</p>

                        <p> Piled Higher and Deeper by Jorge Cham-- this was what
                            decided me on grad school. If I could see myself suffering
                            through all that happens to the graduate students in this
                            comic and still emerging
                            alive, I figured it was going to be worth it. </p>

                        <p> It doesn't get better than xkcd. "A  webcomic of romance,
                            sarcasm, math, and language", it focuses on life and 
                            programming more than science, but
                            xkcd is spot-on when it does and is worth reading singularly for the
                            geek factor.  </p>

                <h4> Awesome Blogs </h4>
                <br>
                <p> There are an amazing amount of excellent science blogs out there.
                    Despite writing one I'm not a huge blog reader unless I'm looking
                    for something specific, so I've done most of my blog-hunting
                    for this page from scratch. I was surprised to see that 
                    commercial or commercial-like PhD blogs usually pop up when you 
                    search for posts; I far prefer
                    blogs where you know who the author is, so I've tended to include
                    more of those. Happy reading!

                        from PhD students mainly at the
                        University of Warwick with a nice tone </li>

                    <li> Another <a href="https://thesiswhisperer.com">collection of posts</a> from
                        PhD students, nicely curated </li>
                    <li> Mallory Ladd has an excellent
                        <a href="http://www.malloryladd.com">blog</a>, especially with regards to 
                        help on the NSF graduate application
                    </li>
                    <li> Neil Saunders's <a href="https://nsaunders.wordpress.com/blog/">blog</a>
                        is an example of a more data-oriented blog; less about the 
                        experience of being a PhD student and more about projects. 
                        This type of blog is quite fun as well and you're more likely
                        to encounter them when searching for resolving bugs and 
                        getting sidetracked. </li>
                    <li> I'm intrigued by the <a href="http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/10/best-blogs-analytics-big-data-science-machine-learning.html">list</a>
                        of blogs here on "Analytics, Big Data, Data Mining, Data Science, Machine Learning"
                        but haven't had a chance to do more than a brief glance through. More
                        science and data blogs! </li>
                    <li> <a href="http://www.academiaobscura.com">Academia Obscura</a>
                        has blog posts on all the academic papers published on 
                        Star Wars, as well as evaluations of citation programs. They're great. </li>
                    <li> Here's the <a href="https://churchlandlab.org">Churchland Lab blog</a>,
                        a great example of a blog written by a PI about lab activities. The <a href="https://fairhalllab.com/blog/">Fairhall Lab</a> blog is great as well.</li>
                    <li> More blogs! <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/">Study Hacks blog</a>, tenure-track <a href="http://getalifephd.blogspot.co.uk">blog</a></li>
                    <li> It can fun to follow scientists on their websites or Twitter- Steven Pinker
                        posts on Twitter and has lectures on his <a href="http://stevenpinker.com/pages/media">website</a>,
                        for example </li>
                    <li> WHOA there are a lot of science blogs at <a href=http://scientopia.org">Scientopia</a>
                    <li> This was another blog I found while searching for specific advice- 
                        <a href="http://science-professor.blogspot.co.uk/2007/12/writing-to-me.html">FemaleScienceProfessor</a>
